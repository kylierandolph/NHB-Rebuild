# NHB-Rebuild
NHB (New Hobby Box) site rebuild

Attempting to re-build a pre-existing site (<i>newhobbybox.com</i>) that was built with the "Crate Joy Designer Tool" (Similar to Wix) and make the email sign up form easier for mobile users and not require credit card information. 

Currently, in order to sign up for emails, a pop up comes up and only the email is captured. I believe it makes a better UX if users can be directed to an actual form rather than a pop up. 

Navigation Items:<br>
    HOME - Provides a sign up form & Brief description of NHB<br>
    <strike>SHOP - Links to ecommerce page powered by CrateJoy<br></strike>
    LEARN - Links to WP site with a list of tutorials<br>
    SUBSCRIBE - Links to a 'checkout' powered by STRIPE<br>
    
    
    
    
To complete Code Louisville's Front End Project requirements, "Home" will be complete with user interactivity but the "Learn" and "Subscribe" nav items link to my pre-existing sites. (With the intention to complete during Code Louisville's FSJS course.) 


If you're looking at this and see something that just seems strange- please let me know! Most of my knowledge is from online videos and would love to hear from a 'real person' :-)
